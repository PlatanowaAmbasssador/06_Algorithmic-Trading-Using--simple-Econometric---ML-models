# Machine Learning in Finance 1 - Project
## Algorithmic investment strategies using simple ML and econometric models
#### Kamil Kashif & Damian Åšlusarczyk

## Description

### Aim
This project aims to check which of the used models helps us obtain the best strategy for trading AAPL stock. We predict stock price movement direction, therefore it is a classification problem.

### Data
We use AAPL stock prices between 2013 and 2023 obtained from Yahoo! Finance. As a part of feature engineering, we calculate technical indicators.

### Models
We use the following ML/econometric models:
- linear regression with elastic net (the numerical output is transformed to categorical data),
- logistic regression with elastic net,
- random forest.
All models are implemented in `scikit learn` library.

### Performance metrics
Because our goal is to make the best investment strategy, instead of using ML performance metrics, we use performance metrics for investment strategies. Our main performance metric is **Information ratio\*\***.

### Validation approach
We use walk forward approach for validation and hyperparameter tuning. For details see `02_linear_and_logit_regressions.ipynb` and `03_ML_random_forest_model.ipynb`.
